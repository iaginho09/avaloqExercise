# Description of the Solution:

This is a simple proyect in wich I developed a bookmarks manager. I used redux for the Store of the bookmarks and Angular Material for the interface.
The application has 2 main parts, the one with the form where you can add new bookmarks, an the other part with the list of the bookmarks you have.In this list, you can also order the bookmarks by group or delete them.

## Screenshots of the working solution

In the following screenshots you can see how is the application running:

After that, I added some new bookmarks

And finally I delete some of the bookmarks
